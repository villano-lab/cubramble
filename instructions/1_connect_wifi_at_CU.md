trying to get it to talk to the wifi CU Denver (secure). 

The basic problem is that I can't boot into something that recognizes our Wifi; I guess I could try CU Denver Guest?
Without some form of internet you can't ssh to the machine, or connect to the outside world. Maybe I could also try the wired internet on eth0?
