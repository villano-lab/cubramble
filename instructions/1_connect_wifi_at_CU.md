trying to get it to talk to the wifi CU Denver (secure). 

The basic problem is that I can't boot into something that recognizes our Wifi; I guess I could try CU Denver Guest?
Without some form of internet you can't ssh to the machine, or connect to the outside world. Maybe I could also try the wired internet on eth0? 

When I switched to the 64-bit version of raspian with the GUI interface I was able to sign into CU Denver Guest in the usual way (when I opened a browser it took me to the "agree" page). I was not able to ssh to the machine even if I switched my laptop to CU Denver Guest.
